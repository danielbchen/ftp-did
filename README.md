## A Difference-in-Differences Analysis of Florida's Family Transition Program

This project analyzes [Florida's Family Transition Program ](https://www.mdrc.org/publication/family-transition-program). The program introduced time limited welfare benefits and estimated the effects of time limited benefits on economic outcomes such as employment and income. 

I implement a difference in differences approach to estimate the efects of the time limit on participants rate of employment. Instead of the simple pre and post period model, I examine period specific treatment effects throughout the duration of the study using R.
